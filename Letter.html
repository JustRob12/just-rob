Dear Lady Marianne O. Bauyot, 
 </p>
 <p> I created this Website Project for you. More like early christmas gift ko sayo. 
    I made this for you because you are very special to me, and I want to give you all the love that you deserves.
    Talking with you for almost 7 months, I learned a lot of things from you and tungod sab sa atong
    pag-uban. And here I am until now, you still leave me weak in the knees.</p>
<p>The things i love about you is your personality, character, and all the things that you do to me. I like your humor and your laugh. I love your smell, your hair, your skin.
    I'm very amaze of your capabilities. Your smile brightens up my day, even on my worst days, I feel happier because of your smile.. I love your voice, especially when you sing. 
    I'm so grateful for everything you do for me, including imong mga libre and even your wonderful hair rubs.
I truly think you are the most beautiful women in the world. I Love Everything About You. You truly made me fall inlove with you without even trying. </p>
<p> You truly complete me. These last few months have been the happiest of my life. I can't even express how fortunate I feel to have my crushiecakes by my side at all times.</p>
<p>Unfortonately, we encounter problems and we decide to stop this feeling. But i didnt stop, because i dont want to. 
    I caused too much problems, na nagpadungag sab sa imong personal problems. I understand that your scared and 
    di pa ready to get back again sa ing-aning na relationship. I'm very very very sorry for all the bad things na nabuhat nako sa imo. 
    <p>One day when you are ready to fall inlove again with someone, I hope that someone is still me. If you give me a chance again, I promise that I will do my bestest to make you feel that you have someone that you truly trust and someone you can lean on. If dugay paman na na adlaw, 
        I will continue loving you, through good times and bad, no matter what. I promise to always be totally honest and devoted to you. Liligawan tika adlaw-adlaw. Mag wait ko sa imo, 
        because you are the one that i need. And gusto nako makauban sa pagtiguang.  </p>
    <p> Have a wonderful christmas holiday to you and to your family. </p>
    <p>I love you, mahal.</p>
